Python combines features from multiple languages:

- **Functional Programming** → inspired by Lisp/Haskell  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** → inspired by C++  
- **Scripting** → inspired by Perl & Shell scripting  
- **Modular Programming** → inspired by Modula-3

Syntax is also influenced by **C and ABC** languages.
